## TypeScript support (added)

This frontend has been made TypeScript-ready. Files using TypeScript/TSX were added under `src/app/services` and `src/features/vehicles` (RTK Query service and simple vehicle list/detail UI).

To finish setup locally run (from the `CarHiveFrontend` folder):

```powershell
npm install
```

Then start the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- A `tsconfig.json` is included. The project uses `allowJs: true` so JS and TS can coexist during incremental migration.
- If you want full TypeScript conversion, rename `.jsx` files to `.tsx` and add types gradually.
