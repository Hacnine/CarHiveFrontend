### Short project description
Carhive is a responsive, design-focused frontend for a car rental marketplace. It demonstrates a pixel-focused UI built with React, Vite and Tailwind CSS and includes pages for browsing vehicles, viewing details, and managing a rental list.

This repository contains the frontend only ‚Äî UI components, styles, and client-side features. Backend API integration and developer documentation are kept separate from this high-level project README.

### Key highlights
- Clean, componentized React UI with Tailwind utilities
- Responsive layouts and accessible components
- Integration-ready patterns (RTK Query examples are present in the codebase)
- TypeScript-ready areas for API services

### Features
- Sticky header
- Sidebar navigation
- Responsive car listing and detail views
- Context-based global state for cart/rental list
- Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, headers)

### Tech stack
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Material-UI (MUI) for some components
- React Router DOM
- RTK Query (example services)
- React Datepicker, React Icons

### TypeScript support
Parts of the app (notably API services under `src/app/services` and some features) are prepared for TypeScript usage. The codebase remains primarily JavaScript, but can be migrated incrementally.

### Where to find developer docs
- Detailed integration instructions and API examples have been moved to the repository docs. If you need those docs added here again, tell me and I can either:
  - restore a compact developer section in this README, or
  - create a separate `docs/` folder (recommended) and add `docs/API.md` with full API integration details.
