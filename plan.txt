        "white-green": "#eafae8ff",   and my site description: 1. Visitor & Account Setup

A visitor lands on the site — sees the homepage, fleet of cars, filters by location, dates, car type.

The visitor chooses “Sign Up / Log In” (if required) — user creates an account with details: name, driver licence, contact, payment method, maybe verification.

If first-time, the system may prompt verification of identity/driver licence (depending on business policy).

2. Browse Cars & Select Rental

User enters rental criteria: pick-up location, pick-up date/time, drop-off location & date/time, car type (SUV, sedan), extras (GPS, baby seat).

System checks inventory & availability: displays only cars available in that hole of time at that location. (If not available, suggest alternatives)

User filters and selects a car listing. On the car details page: vehicle specs, multiple images, rental rate (hourly/daily), terms (mileage limit, fuel policy), insurance options.

User maybe selects extras/add-ons, enters coupon code if any, sees total cost estimate.

3. Booking & Payment

User submits a booking request: picks car, dates/times, extras → system calculates price (base rate × days/hours + extras + location fees + insurance) 
rentware.com
+1

System prompts for payment / deposit. Payment may happen fully or partial (deposit) depending on policy. If payment fails → user is prompted to retry.

Once payment is successful, booking is confirmed: car is reserved (inventory flagged as unavailable for that time slot).

User receives confirmation email/SMS with booking details: car info, pick-up location/time, drop-off location/time, booking number, terms & conditions.

4. Pre-Pickup & Vehicle Preparation

Rental company (or system) flags the car for preparation: cleaning, full fuel, inspection, any maintenance tasks, upload car condition images.

The car status moves from “available” → “reserved” → “ready for pickup”.

At pickup time, there may be check-in of user documents (driver licence, ID), signature of rental agreement (digital or paper), deposit held (if applicable), record of fuel/mileage/condition.

5. Car Handover / Pickup

User arrives at pick-up location (or car is delivered). Employee (or system) verifies user, id, licence.

Condition check: record current mileage, fuel level, publish any pre-existing damage. Optionally user signs off.

Key handover, user drives off. The system status updates to “in-use”.

6. During Rental Period

While car is “in use”, the system may track: time, location (optionally GPS), mileage, extras usage, potential over-time or late drop-off.

If user wants to extend rental: there is flow to “extend booking” — check availability beyond original drop-off time & get price difference.

If user drops car at different location (if multi-location allowed) → system needs to handle cross-location fees, logistics.

7. Return / Drop-Off

At scheduled drop-off date/time, user returns the car to the specified location (or pick-up of car by company).

Condition check: verify mileage, fuel, inspect for new damage. If damage found, record it (photos, cost).

Finalize billing: calculate any extras (late fee, extra mileage, fuel top-up, damage). Generate final invoice.

If deposit held, refund (or deduct) accordingly. Update car status back to “available” or “maintenance” if needed.

Send receipt to user; allow user to review the experience (rating/review).

8. Post-Rental & Maintenance

After return, car may go to maintenance/cleaning if required before being available again. Status “under maintenance” → then “available”. 
Pneumatic

Admin or system tracks metrics: revenue, vehicle utilization, upcoming bookings, maintenance schedules.

Customer service may follow up: asking for feedback, cross-sell future rentals, send promotional offers.

9. Exceptions & Edge Cases

Booking cancellation by user: cancellation policy applies (free cancellation window, fees).

No-show or late return by user: extra charges.

Vehicle breakdown or accident: workflow for reporting, replacement vehicle, insurance claim.

Over-booking prevention: system must lock inventory when booking confirmed.

Multi-location, pick-up & drop at different sites: extra logistic/fee handling.  add here missing more  12 points about work flow of a car rental site.Thought for 26s10. Online Check-in & Digital Rental Agreement
